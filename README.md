# Landing Page Project

### Aim of the project:

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

### Project exuction:

##### index file updates:

   - Added a forth section.

   - Made the sections collapsible.

   - linked the app.js file.

##### css file updates: 

   - Added a red border to the active section to make active state while scrolling more visible.
 
##### js added functionalities: 

   - Creating an unordered list each containing the corresponding section attributrs using fragment.

   - Added active state to the section when reaching half the viewport and remove it after its bottom passes it (not just when the section top is in viewport).

   - Preventing the default action for clicking the anchor links and adding a smooth scroll method.

   - used setTimeout to hide the navbar after scrolling.

   - Measured the page loading speed using performance.now() .

### Resources :

   - A lot of internet search was done on open source sites to understand the new methods suggested by Udacity (ex: getBoundingClientRect()) and i only used the ones that i can fully understand and implement even if they are not the best.
   
   - This project was made completely on an android mobile phone.
